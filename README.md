### SynGEO
SynGeo is a synthetic geometry reasoning engine. It uses classical Euclidean and projective geometry objects, tracks geometric invariants, and produces short human-readable proof sketches for standard geometric facts.
The goal is not numeric computation, but structure, invariants, and reasoning.


##### SynGeo allows you to:

- Define points, lines, circles

- Detect and reason about:

  - collinearity
  
  - concurrency
  
  - cyclicity

- Compute and use:

  - directed ratios
  
  - cross ratios
  
  - harmonic division
  
  - power of a point
  
  - radical axes

- Apply Ceva’s and Menelaus’ theorems

- Work in projective geometry using homogeneous coordinates

- Perform basic automated lemma chaining

- Structure olympiad-style geometry problems programmatically

- Instead of returning booleans, the system outputs proof-style explanations.

##### Mathematical scope

Covered topics include:

  - Synthetic Euclidean geometry
  
  - Projective geometry (points at infinity, duality)
  
  - Classical invariants
  
  - Triangle geometry (Ceva, Menelaus)
  
  - Circle geometry (power of a point, radical axis)
  
  - Foundations of automated geometric reasoning
